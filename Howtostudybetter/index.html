    <h2> Metacognitive tip </h2>
<p> If you're stuck on an exercise, try talking about it out loud. Speaking (and hearing) activates a different part of your brain. Although it works best if you have another person to discuss it with, pets work too

<p>Speak to other people, when you're genuinely stuck. Speak to your classmates, peers, or the instructor</p>
<p>Ask someone else for a different perspective on how to solve problems or a different analogy to understand</p>
    <p> To learn better is to try to make sense of a problem before talking to someone about the issue</p>

    <p>Things an object can do are called</p>
    <ul>
    <li> Methods</li>
    </ul>

    <p>  Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent an object's state (The date) and can have unique values for each object of that type.   </p>
    <p> A class is not an object (but it's used to construct them) A class is a blueprint for an object </p>
    <p> It takes two classes to create an object </p>
    <p> One class for the type of object you want to create </p>
    <p> Another class to test your new class </p>
    <p> A real object java application is nothing but onjects talking to other objects, talking means objects calling other objects</p>
