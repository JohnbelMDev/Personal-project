    <h2 style="color:red"> How to approach a problem logically  </h2>
    <p> visualize the situation, identify the actual problem, and comprehend the problem </p>
    <p> First,deal with the problem qualitative and quantitative aspects of the problem</p>
    <p style="color: blue"> Qualitative means relating to the nature or standard of something, rather than to its quantity.</p>
    <p style="color: red"> Quantitative means relating to, measuring, or measured by the quantity of something rather than its quality
    </p>

    <p>Interpret the problem in light of your own knowledge and experience when approaching a problem. This help to decide what information is important, what information can be ignored and what information may be needed  </p>

    <dl>

          <dd> (1) Comprehend the problem. </dd>
          <dd> (2) Represent the problem in formal terms.</dd>
          <dd> (3) Plan a solution </dd>
          <dd> (4) Execute the plan.</dd>
          <dd> (5) Interpret and evaluate the solution.</dd>

        <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Specific physics strategy</h3>
    <ol>
        <h3 style="color: darkblue">How to focus on the problem:</h3>
        <li>
        <p>Develop a qualitative description of the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
        <p> Visualize the events described in the problem using a sketch.</p>
    </li>
        <li>
            <p>Write down a simple statement of what you want to find out .</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Write down the physics ideas which might be useful in the problem and describe the approach you will use .</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Describe the physics:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <p> First use qualitative description of the problem to prepare for the quantitative solution.  </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Simplify the problem situation by describing it with a diagram in terms of simple physical projects and essential physical quantities </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Restate the problem and focus on what you want to find by naming specific variables  </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Plan the solution</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> Translate the problem into a set of equation that represent the problem mathematicaly</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Write down step by step on how you will solve these equations to look at if there's a solution </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Execute the plan </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Execute the solution that was planned </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> Combine the equation as planned to first determine an algebraic solution.</p>
        </li>
       

    </ol>
    <h3 style="color: darkgreen">Evaluate the answer  </h3>
<ol>
    <li> Finally, check the work to see if that is properly stated, reasonable, and that the question was answered</li>
</ol>
